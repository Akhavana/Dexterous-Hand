# Overview
The Dexterous-Hand ROS2 project integrates EMG sensors and the ROKOKO Smartglove to enable robotic grasping control within a ROS2 environment.

# Getting Started
Before running the system, ensure the following components are set up:

## EMG Setup
Follow the installation steps for libEMG: libemg-ros on GitHub
Note: A different training method will be used in this project, but completing the libEMG installation is recommended.

## ROKOKO Smartglove Setup
Recommended to use Mac or Windows for faster processing.
A 5G internet connection can significantly improve the setup and data transmission speed.
